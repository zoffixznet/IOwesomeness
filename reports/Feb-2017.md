## Timing

I'm currently running slightly behind the schedule outlined in the grant. I expect to complete
the Action Plan and have it ratified by other core members by March 18th, which is the date of
the 2017.03 compiler release. Then, I'll implement all of the Action Plan (and complete the grant)
by the next 2017.04 compiler release on April 15th. This is also the release the next
Rakudo Star distribution will be based on, and so the regular end users will receive better
IO there and then.

## User Communications

I wrote and disseminated advanced notice of the changes to be made due to this grant, to prepare
the users to expect some code to break (some routines were found to be documented, despite being
absent entirely from the [Specification](https://github.com/perl6/roast/tree/6.c-errata) and
not officially part of the language.

The notice can be seen at: [http://rakudo.org/2017/02/26/advance-notice-of-significant-changes/
    ](http://rakudo.org/2017/02/26/advance-notice-of-significant-changes/)

## Bonus Deliverable
 
The bonus deliverable—The Map of Perl 6 Routines—is now usable, code is available in
[perl6/routine-map](https://github.com/perl6/routine-map) repository, and the rendered version
is available on [map.perl6.party](https://map.perl6.party). It served its purpose
for this grant, but I'll certainly add improvements to it sometime in the future, such as linking
to docs, linking to routines' source code, having an IRC bot looking stuff up in it, etc.

It'll also be fairy easy to use the Map to detect undocumented routines or ones that are
documented under the incorrect type.

## Identified Issues/Deficiencies with IO Routines

These points, issues, and ideas will be included for consideration in the Action Plan.

- calling practically any method on a closed IO::Handle results in an LTA (Less Than Awesome)
    error message: `<something> an object with REPR MVMOSHandle` where `<something>` is
    sometimes the name of the method called by the user and others is some internal method
    invoked indirectly. We need a better model of closed file handles; something that would avoid a
    `is-fh-closed()` type of conditional called in all the methods, which would be a hefty
    performance hit.
- Several routines have been identified which in other languages return useful information:
    number of bytes actually written or current file position, whereas in Perl 6 they just
    return a Bool (`.print`, `.say`, `.write`) or a Mu type object (`.seek`). Inconsistently,
    `.printf` does appear to return the number of bytes written. It should be possible
    to make other routines similarly useful, although I suspect some of it may have to
    wait until 6.d language release.
- The `.seek` routine takes the seek location as one of three Enum values. Not only are they
    quite lengthy to type, they're globally available for no good reason and `.seek` is virtually
    unique in using this calling convention. I will seek to standardize this routine to take
    mutually-exclusive named arguments instead, preferably with much shorter names, but those
    are yet to be bikeshed.
- `IO.umask` routine simply shells out to `umask`. This fails terribly on OSes that don't have
    that command, especially since the code still tries to decode the received input as
    an octal string, even after the failure. Needs improvement.
- `link`'s implementation and documentation confuses what a "target" is. Luckily (or sadly?)
    there are exactly zero tests for this routine in the Perl 6 Specification, so we can
    change it to match the behaviour of `ln` Linux command and the `foo $existing-thing, $new-thing`
    argument order of `move`, `rename`, and other similar routines.
- *Documentation:* several inaccuracies in the documentation were found. I won't be identifing
    these in my reports/Action Plan, but will simply ensure the documentation matches the
    implementation once the Action Plan is fully implemented.


## Discovered Bugs

The hunt for 6-legged friends has these finds so far:

#### Will (attempt to) fix as part of the grant

- indir() has a race condition where the actual dir it runs in ends up being wrong.
    Using `indir '/tmp/useless', { qx/rm -fr */ }` in one thread and backing
    up your precious data in another has the potential to result in some spectacular failurage.
- `perl6 -ne '@ = lines'` crashes after first iteration, crying about `MVMOSHandle REPR`. I suspect
    the code is failing to follow iterator protocol somewhere and is attempting to read
    on an already closed handle. I expect to be able to resolve this and the related
    [RT#128047](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128047) as part of the grant.
- `.tell` incorrectly always returns `0` on files opened in append mode
- `link` mixes up target and link name in its error message


#### Don't think I will be able to fix these as part of the grant

- `seek()` with `SeekFromCurrent` as location fails to seek correctly if called
    after `.readchars`, but only on MoarVM. This appears to occur due to some sort of buffering.
    I filed this as [RT#130843](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130843).
- On JVM, `.readchars` incorrectly assumes all chars are 2 bytes long. This appears to be
    just a naive substitute for nqp::readcharsfh op. I filed this as
    [RT#130840](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130840).


#### Already Fixed

- While making the Routine Map, I discovered .WHICH and .Str methods on IO::Special were `only`
    methods defined only for the :D subtype, resulting in a crash when using, say, infix:<eqv>
    operator on the type object, instead Mu.WHICH/.Str candidates getting invoked.
    This bug was easy and I already commited fix in
    [radudo/dd4dfb14d3](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/dd4dfb14d3ccfe50dbd4b425778a005d3303edb9)
    and tests to cover it in
    [roast/63370fe054](https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/63370fe0546eded34cbaa695f6d928aa3db42395)

#### Auxiliary Bugs

While doing the work for this grant, I also discovered some non-IO related bugs (some of which I fixed):

- .Bool, .so, .not, .hash, and .elems on Baggy:U crash
    [fixed in e8af8553](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e8af8553eae9abfe4f5cd02dcf4114c5c4877c51)
- .sort on reified empty arrays crashes [reported as RT#130866](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130866)
- SEGV with Scalar type object in unique() [reported as RT#130852](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130852)
- .Bool, .so, .not and possibly others crash on Seq:U; need to evaluate entire codebase to see where `only`
    methods are used instead of `multi`, preventing dispatch to Mu.* candidates. [reported as RT#130867
    ](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130867)
- Incorrect line number reported for wrong routine call when unpacking/heredocs are used [reported
    as RT#130862](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130862#ticket-history)
- Warnings produced by core code marked as "shouldn't happen" [reported as
    RT#130857](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130857#ticket-history)
