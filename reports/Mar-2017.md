# Perl 6 IO TPF Grant: Monthly Report (March, 2017)

This document is the February, 2017 progress report for [TPF Standardization,
Test Coverage, and Documentation of Perl 6 I/O Routines
grant](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2017/01/grant-proposal-standardization.html)

## Bugs

The hunt for 6-legged friends has these finds so far:

#### Will (attempt to) fix as part of the grant


#### Don't think I will be able to fix these as part of the grant



#### Already Fixed

- Fixed IO::Pipe.lines not accepting a Whatever as limit, which is accepted by
    all other .lines. In addition, I was able to switch it to use the much
    faster IO::Handle.lines method, making it 3.2x faster. [rakudo/0c6281](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0c6281518e5c78113121968df0cf7404aa949dd3)
    Tests in [roast/465795](https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/465795c458041e66e33e32e2de2b8cd358be5961) and [roast/add852](https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/add852b082a2fca83dbefe03d890dd5939c5ff45)
- IO::Path.Bridge was defunct, as it was trying to call .Bridge on Str, which
    does not exist. Resolved the issue by deleting this method in [rakudo/212cc8](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/212cc8ae5d)
- Fixed issues due to caching of `IO::Handle.e`. Reported as
    [RT#130889](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130889). Fixed in
    [rakudo/76f718](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/76f71878da61731f33b457e84c7b0e801c64af66).
    Tests in [roast/908348](https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/908348eef18b1c33f1bd8d879b9bb16f002fb6f7)
- Per demand, made `IO::Path.dir` a multi, so module-space can augment it with
    other candidates that add more functionality. [rakudo/fbe7ace](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/fbe7ace6fc19d86ac1cb0519654e4239c1a17129)


#### Auxiliary Bugs

While doing the work for this grant, I also discovered some non-IO related bugs (some of which I fixed):
