# Perl 6 IO TPF Grant: Monthly Report (April, 2017)

This document is the April, 2017 progress report for [TPF Standardization,
Test Coverage, and Documentation of Perl 6 I/O Routines
grant](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2017/01/grant-proposal-standardization.html)

## Timing

As proposed to and approved by the Grant Manager, I've extended the due date
for this grant by 1 extra month, in exchange for doing some extra optimization
work on IO routines at no extra cost. The new compleetion date is May 22nd;
right after the next Rakudo compiler release.

## Communications

I've created and published three notices as part of this grant, informing the
users on what is changing and how to best upgrade their code, where needed:

- [Upgrade Information for Changes Due to IO Grant Work](http://rakudo.org/2017/04/02/upgrade-information-for-changes-due-to-io-grant-work/)
- [PART 2: Upgrade Information for Changes Due to IO Grant Work](http://rakudo.org/2017/04/03/part-2-upgrade-information-for-changes-due-to-io-grant-work/)
- [PART 3: Information on Changes Due to IO Grant Work](http://rakudo.org/2017/04/17/final-notes-on-changes-due-to-io-grant-work/)


## IO Action Plan Progress

Most of the [IO Action Plan](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/2017-IO-Grant--Action-Plan.md) has been implemented and got shipped in Rakudo's 2017.04.2 release. The remaining items are:

- Implement better way to signal closed handle status (was omited from release due to original suggestion to do this not being ideal; likely better to do this on the VM end)
- Implement IO::CatHandle as a generalized IO::ArgFiles (was omited from release because it was decided to make it mostly-usable wherever IO::Handle can be used, and IO::ArgFiles is far from that, having only a handful of methods implemented)
- Optimization of the way we perform `stat` calls for multiple file tests (entirely internal that requires no changes to users' code)


## Documentation and Coverage Progress

In my spreadsheet with all the IO routines and their candidates, the totals
show that 40% have been documented and tested. Some of the remaining 60% may
already have tests/docs added when implementing IO Action Plan or ealier and
merely need checking and verification.

## Optimizations

Some of the optimizations I promised to deliver in exchange for grant deadline
extension were already done on IO::Spec::Unix and IO::Path
routines and have made it into the 2017.04.2 release. Most of the optimizations
that will be done in the upcoming month will be done in IO::Spec::Win32 and
will largely affect Windows users.

#### IO Optimizations in 2017.04.2 Done by Other Core Members:

- Elizabeth Mattijsen made .slurp 2x faster [rakudo/b4d80c0](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b4d80c0)
- Samantha McVey made nqp::index—which is used in path operations—2x faster [rakudo/f1fc879](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f1fc879)
- IO::Pipe.lines was made 3.2x faster by relying on work done by Elizabeth Mattijsen [rakudo/0c62815](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0c62815)

## Tickets Resolved

The following tickets have been resolved as part of the grant:

- [RT#130460 Can we relax indir's test on the target directory?](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130460): Resolved by making indir's default test to be only `:d`
- [RT#130900: nul in pathname](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130900): Resolved by checking the path for nul and throwing when found
- [RT#127407: [RFC] (1) add method IO::Path.stemname; (2) expand method IO::Path.parts](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Update.html?id=127407): RFC rejected, but the described functionality is now available via the .extension method that was made much more powerful as part of IO Action Plan

Possibly more tickets were addressed by the IO Action Plan implementation, but
they still need further review.

## Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `IO::Path.resolve` with combiners tucked on the path
    separator. Fix in
[rakudo/9d8e391f3b](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9d8e391f3b452efeb06c860e37293c696b244786);
tests in
[roast/92217f75ce](https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/92217f75ce9392466eb14fc562911fc21a83a02e). The bug was identified by Timo Paulssen while testing secure implementation of IO::Path.child

#### IO Bug Fixes in 2017.04.2 Done by Other Core Members:

- Timo Paulssen fixed a bug with IO::Path types not being accepted by
`is native` NativeCall trait [rakudo/99840804](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9984080413c9c236f9e8a35fded928a65cb9810a)
- Elizabeth Mattijsen fixed an issue in assignment to dynamics. This made it possible to `temp` `$*TMPDIR` variable [rakudo/1b9d53](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1b9d53ce5ed1e9e1c546f39fbec4fe342667ed1c)
- Jonathan Worthington fixed a crash when slurping large files in binary mode with &slurp or IO::Path.slurp [rakudo/d0924f1a2](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d0924f1a287bd2966c1dec156d135f2447ca21da)
- Jonathan Worthington fixed a bug with binary slurp reading zero bytes when another thread is causing a lot of GC [rakudo/756877e](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/756877e)
