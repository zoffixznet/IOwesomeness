# Changes with Backwards-Compatible Support

The changes proposed in this section allow for retention of old behaviour.
It is proposed the old behaviour to be removed entirely in 6.d language.

Note: since our current infrastructure for 6.d language is **additive,** the
behaviour proposed for removal in 6.d might not end up actually being removed
from the code, but instead marked as deprecated with warnings/exceptions issued
on use (and appropriately documented as being obsolete).
