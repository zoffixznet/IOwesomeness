## Make `:close` behaviour the default in `IO::Handle` and Its Subclasses [[Issue for discussion]](https://github.com/zoffixznet/IOwesomeness/issues/15)

- [✘] docs (`:close` is mentioned only for `.comb` and only in signature and a example's comment, not prose)
- [✘] roast (`:close` is *used* in tests for `.words` and `.comb` but its functionality is not tested)

**Current behaviour:**

The routines `&slurp`, `IO::Path.slurp`, `&lines`, `IO::Path.lines`, `&comb`,
`IO::Path.comb`, `IO::Path.words`, `IO::Path.split`, and the
corresponding `IO::ArgFiles` routines **close the filehandle at the end.**

Contrary to that pattern, `IO::Handle` and `IO::Pipe` routines `.slurp-rest`,
`.lines`, `.words`, `.comb`, and `.split` do *NOT* close the handle by default
(I would assume some sort of closage is done for pipes, but preliminary tests
showed omitting `:close` on `IO::Pipe.slurp-rest` in a 3000-iteration loop
causes a coredump on circa 2017.02 Rakudo)

**Proposed behaviour:**

- Remove `:close` parameter
- Add `:leave-open` `Bool` parameter that defaults to `False`. Close the
handle when the iterator is exhausted, unless `:leave-open` parameter is set
to `True`

A March 22, 2017 ecosystem grep showed 1125 potential calls to the methods, yet
only one match came up for the `close` parameter on the same line: the
`perl6/doc` repository. Thus, no one seems to be using the `:close` parameter. My guess would be this is due to ignorance of its existence and
that the programs are leaking filehandles, rather than the users explicitly closing the filehandle elsewhere in the program in a way that my grep did
not pick it up.

```bash
    $ grep -FR -e '.comb' -e '.lines' -e '.words' -e '.slurp-rest' | wc -l
    1125
    $ grep -FR -e '.comb' -e '.lines' -e '.words' -e '.slurp-rest' | grep close | wc -l
    1
```

Also, it's likely much more common to wish to close the filehandle at the end
in these methods than not to. The operations provide the file as basically a
stream of chunks: whole (`.slurp-rest`), line-sized (`.lines`), word-sized
(`.words`), pattern- or character-sized (`.comb`), letting the user perform
most possible operations without needing to `.seek` to another file position
after exhausting the iterator (which would require the handle to be kept open).
